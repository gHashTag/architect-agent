# Supporting Wall

## Overview
When preparing a construction site or arranging their plot, residents often change the existing terrain. When constructing buildings of various purposes on slopes or preparing a construction site, a fairly thick layer of soil is sometimes cut or backfill soil is added. Adjacent plots or their parts remain significantly higher or lower than the plot being arranged. In one case, neighbors worry that their structures or soil might end up in a lower terrain plot, in another - that sliding backfill soil might cause damage to their property. A supporting wall, installed in compliance with the requirements for this engineering structure, can protect against such hazards.

## Purpose and Requirements
The purpose of a supporting wall is to retain the soil behind it so that it doesn't collapse or slide. Therefore, the wall structures must be designed and installed to withstand soil pressure. It is especially important to provide appropriate wall thickness, its reinforcement, the need for anchors, and their fastening locations.

A supporting wall is a wall that must withstand the pressure of retained material. The wall foundation consists of reinforced concrete piles and a foundation beam. The supporting wall is constructed using HAUS formwork blocks. Depending on the height of the supporting wall and the acting loads, HAUS P6-20, P25, or HAUS P6-30 concrete blocks are selected.

## Available Block Types
