# Partition Walls

## Overview
Internal walls that only bear their own weight are designed using first category concrete blocks HAUS SM6 or S6 according to standard EN 771-3. The density of used concrete masonry products is ≥ 950 kg/m³. The normalized average compressive strength for SM6 concrete blocks is fb = 4.3 N/mm², and for S6 - fb = 4.5 N/mm², as determined according to LST EN 771-3:2011.

## Block Installation
According to LST EN 1996-1-1:2005 requirements, masonry products must be bonded by offsetting products by distance a:
- Minimum masonry product bonding offset length: 10 cm
- At wall corners, the masonry product offset size a must be no less than the product width bu and a ≥ hu

HAUS SM6 and S6 concrete blocks are laid using general-purpose masonry mortar of class M5. Horizontal joint thickness is 10-15 mm, depending on horizontal reinforcement.

Vertical masonry joints are filled with masonry mortar. The mortar must comply with LST EN 1998-2 requirements.

### Winter Construction
When not using special anti-frost additives, the temperature of mixtures used in winter must not be lower than +5°C. When laying in negative temperatures, frost-resistant chemical additives that do not cause corrosion of masonry materials (potash, sodium nitrite, mixed additives, etc.) are used, hardening in cold without heating.

## Fire Resistance
According to the sustainable product standard LST EN 771-3+A1:2005, HAUS S6 and HAUS SM6 blocks comply with fire class A1. HAUS SM6 masonry walls fire resistance values:

Dressing - with gypsum plaster according to EN 13279-1 standards on both sides.

## Intersecting Walls Joint
Intersecting load-bearing walls must be joined in such a way that the necessary vertical and lateral forces can be transferred between them (according to EN 1996-1-1:2005).

The wall intersection joint can be made from:
- Masonry bonding
- Connectors
- Reinforcement extended into both walls

Intersecting walls must be laid at the same time.

## Lintel Installation
Reinforced lintels made from HAUS P6-20, P25, or P6-30 formwork blocks are designed as two-span beams. Formwork blocks are installed with a bottom wall cutout for the lintel tension reinforcement. Reinforcement amount and concrete class are selected according to acting loads.

Before concreting the lintel, block surfaces are moistened with water.

## Thin Partition Walls
Internal walls that only bear their own weight are designed using first category concrete blocks HAUS SP according to standard EN 771-3. The density of used concrete masonry products is ≥ 1050 kg/m³. The normalized average compressive strength is fb = 4.3 N/mm², as determined according to LST EN 771-3:2011.

### Technical Characteristics
- [HAUS SP](https://www.vbg.lt/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ECD_SP.pdf) - Technical specifications

### Block Installation
- Minimum masonry product bonding offset length: 10 cm
- At wall corners, the masonry product offset size a must be no less than the product width bu
- Horizontal joint thickness: 10-15 mm, depending on horizontal reinforcement
- A 3-4 cm gap is left between the last masonry row and the floor, later filled with thermal insulation material and intermediate layer

### Fire Resistance
HAUS SP blocks comply with fire class A1. HAUS SP masonry walls fire resistance values:

| Purpose | Load Level | Fire Resistance Criteria | Time (min) |
|---------|------------|-------------------------|------------|
| Without Dressing | With Dressing | | |
| Separating Non-Load-Bearing Walls | None | EI | 60 | 120 |

Dressing - with gypsum plaster according to EN 13279-1 standards on both sides.

### Lintel Installation for Thin Walls
HAUS SP concrete block lintels are reinforced with UW type profile (100x40x0.6), which is anchored in the horizontal masonry joint at a distance lUW ≥ 120 mm. Two Ø8 S240 class bars are placed and concreted inside the profile, anchored in the masonry horizontal joint at a distance lAs1 ≥ 400 mm.
