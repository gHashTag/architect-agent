# Column in Masonry

## Overview
HAUS concrete masonry block modifications K1 and K2 have circular openings that, when laid, create a circular cavity. To strengthen the masonry's load-bearing capacity, reinforcement is placed in this cavity and concreted. This creates a hidden reinforced concrete column within the masonry wall. Such columns can be installed in appropriate masonry zones where concentrated loads are present. The possible column spacing is 2.5 m.

Internal walls that only bear their own weight are designed using first category concrete blocks HAUS SM6 or S6 according to standard EN 771-3. The density of used concrete masonry products is ≥ 950 kg/m³. The normalized average compressive strength for SM6 concrete blocks is fb = 4.3 N/mm², and for S6 - fb = 4.5 N/mm², as determined according to LST EN 771-3:2011.

## Block Installation
According to LST EN 1996-1-1:2005 requirements, masonry products must be bonded by offsetting products by distance a:
- Minimum masonry product bonding offset length: 10 cm
- At wall corners, the masonry product offset size a must be no less than the product width bu and a ≥ hu

HAUS SM6 and S6 concrete blocks are laid using general-purpose masonry mortar of class M5. The thickness of horizontal joints is 10-15 mm, depending on horizontal reinforcement. Vertical masonry joints are filled with masonry mortar. The mortar must comply with LST EN 1998-2 requirements.

## Mortar Volume Requirements

| Per m³ wall | 0.09 | 180 |

### HAUS SM6
| Description | Volume (m³) | Weight (kg) |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Per block | 0.0023 | 4.1 |
| Per m² wall | 0.018 | 32.8 |
| Per m³ wall | 0.09 | 164 |

## Concrete Volume Requirements
### HAUS S6 Column
| Description | Volume (m³) | Weight (kg) |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Per column block | 0.0038 | 8.4 |
| Per linear meter of column | 0.019 | 41.8 |

### HAUS SM6 Column
| Description | Volume (m³) | Weight (kg) |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Per column block | 0.0047 | 10.3 |
| Per linear meter of column | 0.019 | 41.8 |

## Winter Construction
- Mixture temperature, if no special anti-frost additives are used, must not be lower than +5°C
- When laying in negative temperatures, frost-resistant chemical additives are used that do not cause corrosion of masonry materials (potash, sodium nitrite, mixed additives, etc.), hardening in cold without heating

## Column Reinforcement
- Minimum diameter of longitudinal reinforcement bars: Ømin ≥ 8 mm
- Column cross-section reinforcement is selected according to safety and serviceability limit states and element construction rules (EN 1992-1-1:2005)
- Longitudinal reinforcement bars must be distributed around the cross-section perimeter
- Longitudinal column reinforcement is connected into spatial frames with transverse bars
- These connections protect longitudinal reinforcement bars from buckling
- Transverse reinforcement diameter must be no less than 6 mm or 0.25 of the maximum longitudinal reinforcement diameter
- Transverse reinforcement must be anchored according to construction rules
- Distance between connections is selected no greater than 400 mm and 20Ø (Ø - minimum longitudinal bar diameter) and the smaller dimension of the column cross-section
