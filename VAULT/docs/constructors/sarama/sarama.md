# Lintel

## Overview
Reinforced lintels made from HAUS P6-20, P25, or P6-30 formwork blocks are designed as two-span beams. Formwork blocks are installed with a bottom wall cutout for the lintel tension reinforcement. An additional wall cutout can be made at the top of the formwork blocks for the lintel compression reinforcement.

The amount of reinforcement and concrete class are selected according to acting loads.

## Block Installation
When lintels are made from two rows of formwork blocks (lintel height 50 cm), masonry products must be bonded according to LST EN 1996-1-1:2005 requirements by offsetting products by distance a:
- Minimum masonry product bonding offset length: 10 cm
- Recommended bonding offset length: 25 cm

## Concrete Work
Concrete work is performed according to ST 121895674.06:2009 "Concrete Work" requirements:
- Concrete mixture is laid in horizontal layers across the entire area of the concrete structure
- For a homogeneous concrete structure, freshly prepared concrete mixture should be laid on the previous compacted layer before cement begins to set
- Before concreting HAUS formwork blocks, their surface is moistened with water
- It is recommended to concrete up to three rows of blocks when concrete slump class is S3 (flowable)
- For high structures, concreting is done in stages. In each stage, three and a half rows of blocks are concreted to ensure bonding between concrete and HAUS formwork blocks
- C20/25 class concrete is used

## Concrete Curing
In the initial stage of hardened concrete, a certain temperature and humidity regime must be maintained:
- Concrete is periodically watered
- In summer, protected from sunlight
- In winter, protected from frost
- Open concrete surfaces are covered no later than 10-12 hours after concreting completion

## Support Requirements
For lintels up to 1.5 m in length, the support can be 150 mm. When selecting the lintel support surface length, it is necessary to consider the masonry bearing capacity in this zone. The support surface must be level and made from solid blocks. It is recommended to support on first group masonry products.

## Protective Concrete Layer
The nominal protective concrete layer is designed according to LST EN 1992-1-1:2005 requirements:
- cmin - minimum protective concrete layer thickness
- Δcdev - protective concrete layer thickness deviation, 10 mm

Minimum concrete layer thickness for longitudinal reinforcement:
- cmin,b - minimum protective concrete layer according to bond requirements (LST EN 1992-1-1 Table 4.2) for separately placed bars equals bar diameter Ø
- cmin,dur - minimum protective concrete layer according to environmental conditions requirements
- Δcdur,γ - additional safety element (recommended value 0 mm)
- Δcdur,st - minimum protective concrete layer reduction if non-rusting steel is used (recommended value 0 mm)
- Δcdur,add - minimum protective concrete layer reduction if additional protection is used (recommended value 0 mm)

The formwork block wall cutout depth is 4 cm, so according to nominal protective concrete layer requirements, it must be increased by cutting out the wall.

## Lintel Reinforcement Selection
Lintel reinforcement is calculated according to Eurocodes LST EN 1992-1-1:2005. The calculated lintel width is taken only between concrete block walls bc = 132 mm.

**Selected lintel reinforcement must be approved by a structural engineer.**

Transverse reinforcement anchoring is performed according to LST EN 1992-1-1:2005 requirements: anchored with hooks (a and b) or welded anchoring reinforcement (c and d).
