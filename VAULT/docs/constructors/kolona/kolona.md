# Column Construction

## Overview
A separate column can be constructed using HAUS KL-28 concrete blocks. The column is mounted on a prepared individual shallow foundation, or if the soil strength is insufficient, pile foundations are made. First, a column of the required height is assembled from blocks. Then the reinforcement frame is inserted and concreted. This creates a circular cross-section column with a diameter of 280 mm.

The column and reinforced concrete or steel beam are connected using embedded concrete parts. The embedded parts and anchoring are selected according to the design situation and acting loads.

## Concrete Volume Requirements
### HAUS KL-28
| Description | Volume (m³) | Weight (kg) |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Per block | 0.017 | 37.4 |
| Per linear meter of column | 0.071 | 157.5 |

## Concrete Work
Concrete work is performed according to ST 121895674.06:2009 "Concrete Work" requirements:
- Concrete mixture is laid in horizontal layers across the entire area of the concrete structure
- For a homogeneous concrete structure, freshly prepared concrete mixture should be laid on the previous compacted layer before cement begins to set
- Before concreting HAUS formwork blocks, their surface is moistened with water
- The column is concreted with C20/25 class concrete after assembling the entire column height
- To ensure stability of the concreted column blocks, reinforcement bars are threaded through the corner holes of the blocks

### Concrete Curing
- Initial curing stage requires maintaining specific temperature and humidity conditions
- Concrete is periodically watered, protected from sun rays in summer and frost in winter
- Open concrete surfaces are covered no later than 10-12 hours after concreting completion
- In summer, concrete made with ordinary Portland cement is watered for seven days
- When air temperature is above 15°C:
  - First three days: watered every 3 hours during day and once at night
  - Later: at least three times per day
- Concrete structure can be watered only after 5-10 hours
- When average daily air temperature is 3°C or lower, concrete may not be watered
- Curing duration is determined considering:
  - Cement hydration rate
  - Concrete properties
  - Ambient temperature
  - Relative humidity
- Typical curing duration ranges from 2 to 10 days
- For concrete requiring water resistance or exposed to unfavorable conditions, curing duration should be extended

## Column Reinforcement
- Column diameter: Ø = 280 mm
- Cover thickness: as = 40 mm
- Concrete class: C20/25
- Reinforcement bars: S500 class

**Note:** The column structure and reinforcement must be approved by the structural engineer.
