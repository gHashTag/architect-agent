# Inter-Apartment Partition Walls

## Overview
Inter-apartment partition walls are designed to provide sound insulation and structural separation between different apartments. Several configurations are available:

1. 28 cm thick single-layer partition with two outlets on both sides (58 dB)
2. 34 cm thick three-layer partition (58 dB)
3. 27 cm thick three-layer partition with air gap and two outlets on one side (56 dB)
4. 31 cm thick three-layer partition without air gap (55 dB)

Wall surfaces are covered with latex plaster.

## Lintel Installation
Three-layer walls around openings are constructed from three rows of HAUS SP concrete blocks. HAUS SP concrete block lintels are reinforced with UW type profile (100x40x0.5), which is anchored in the horizontal masonry joint at a distance lUW ≥ 120 mm. Two Ø8 S240 class bars are placed and concreted inside the profile, anchored in the masonry horizontal joint at a distance lAs1 ≥ 400 mm.

## Block Installation
According to LST EN 1996-1-1:2005 requirements, masonry products must be bonded by offsetting products by distance a:
- Minimum masonry product bonding offset length: 10 cm
- At wall corners, the masonry product offset size a must be no less than the product width bu and a ≥ hu

HAUS SP and HAUS S25 concrete blocks are laid using general-purpose masonry mortar. Horizontal joint thickness is 10-15 mm, depending on horizontal reinforcement. Vertical masonry joints are filled with masonry mortar. The mortar must comply with LST EN 1998-2 requirements.

A 3-4 cm gap is left between the last masonry row and the floor, later filled with thermal insulation material and intermediate layer.

### Winter Construction
When not using special anti-frost additives, the temperature of mixtures used in winter must not be lower than +5°C. When laying in negative temperatures, frost-resistant chemical additives that do not cause corrosion of masonry materials (potash, sodium nitrite, mixed additives, etc.) are used, hardening in cold without heating.

## Wall and Floor Intersections
Wall intersection joints can be made from (LST EN 1996-1-1):
- Masonry bonding
- Connectors or reinforcement extended into both walls

Intersecting walls must be laid at the same time. At wall intersections, masonry bonding is ensured every 1.0 m by anchoring Ø6 S240 reinforcement bars.

The spacing of support ties between walls and floors must not exceed 2 m for buildings up to 4 floors, and 1.25 m for taller buildings (LST EN 1996-1-1). Inter-apartment partition walls are anchored in floors using Ø6 S240 reinforcement bars, which are placed in vertical HAUS SP masonry joints no less frequently than every 1.0 m. A 3-4 cm gap is left between the last masonry row and the floor, later filled with thermal insulation material and intermediate layer.

Masonry reinforcement mesh for crack control or ductility is laid between the first and second, and second-to-last and last masonry rows. The total reinforcement area must not be less than 0.03% of the total wall cross-section area (LST EN 1996-1-1).
