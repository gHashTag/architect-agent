# Monolithic Ring

## Overview
When supporting floors and other structures on masonry blocks, it is recommended to transfer loads to the masonry through a monolithic ring.

For monolithic ring installation, HAUS formwork blocks are recommended. Formwork blocks of 20, 25, or 30 cm width are selected according to the wall construction thickness. This creates a 25 cm high monolithic reinforced concrete ring.

HAUS P6-20, P25, or P6-30 concrete blocks comply with standard EN 771-3. The density of used concrete masonry products is 900 kg/m³, 750 kg/m³, and 700 kg/m³ respectively. The normalized average compressive strength for P6-20, P25, and P6-30 concrete blocks is fb = 3.0 N/mm², as determined according to LST EN 771-3:2011.

## Block Installation
A 25 cm high monolithic ring is assembled from HAUS P6-20, P25, or P6-30 concrete blocks. Blocks are installed without mortar.

If a higher monolithic ring is required (height 50 cm), masonry products must be bonded according to LST EN 1996-1-1:2005 requirements by offsetting products by distance a:
- Minimum masonry product bonding offset length: 10 cm
- Recommended bonding offset length: 25 cm

At monolithic ring corners, to pass longitudinal reinforcement, the side wall of the block must be cut out.

HAUS P6-20, P25, or P6-30 corner formwork blocks can also be used in the middle part of the structure. In this case, the end wall of the block (groove) is cut out.

## Concrete Work
Concrete work is performed according to ST 121895674.06:2009 "Concrete Work" requirements:
- Concrete mixture is laid in horizontal layers across the entire area of the concrete structure
- For a homogeneous concrete structure, freshly prepared concrete mixture should be laid on the previous compacted layer before cement begins to set
- Before concreting HAUS formwork blocks, their surface is moistened with water
- Recommended to concrete up to three rows of blocks when concrete flow class is S3 (flowable)
- For high structures, concreting is done in stages
- Each stage involves concreting three and a half rows of blocks
- C16/20 class concrete is used

### Concrete Curing
- Initial curing stage requires maintaining specific temperature and humidity conditions
- Concrete is periodically watered, protected from sun rays in summer and frost in winter
- Open concrete surfaces are covered no later than 10-12 hours after concreting completion
- In summer, concrete made with ordinary Portland cement is watered for seven days
- When air temperature is above 15°C:
  - First three days: watered every 3 hours during day and once at night
  - Later: at least three times per day
- Concrete structure can be watered only after 5-10 hours
- When average daily air temperature is 3°C or lower, concrete may not be watered
- Curing duration is determined considering:
  - Cement hydration rate
  - Concrete properties
  - Ambient temperature
  - Relative humidity
- Typical curing duration ranges from 2 to 10 days
- For concrete requiring water resistance or exposed to unfavorable conditions, curing duration should be extended

## Reinforcement
- Recommended reinforcement: 4Ø10 S500 longitudinal bars
- Transverse reinforcement: Ø6 S500 bars with 210 mm spacing
- Concrete class: C16/20
- Metal anchors Ø12-Ø16 mm are embedded in the monolithic ring, spaced at 60-100 cm intervals

**Note:** The monolithic ring reinforcement must be approved by the structural engineer.

Transverse reinforcement anchoring is performed according to LST EN 1992-1-1:2005 requirements: anchored with hooks (a and b) or welded anchoring reinforcement (c and d).
