# External Wall for Frame Buildings

## Overview
A wall is an enclosing structure that separates rooms and protects from environmental influences. There are two types of walls: load-bearing and non-load-bearing. Load-bearing walls transfer loads from other building structures and ensure mechanical resistance and stability of the building. Non-load-bearing walls - external and internal walls (partitions) - only bear their own weight at the floor level.

## Thermal Insulation
Concrete block masonry is insulated from the outside with thermal insulation, the thickness of which is calculated according to STR 2.05.01:2005 requirements. Thermal insulation is attached to the wall by gluing and with fasteners. Plates are fastened with fasteners after the glue has hardened. Fasteners are driven flush with the thermal insulation surface. The number of fasteners is selected according to building height, distance to corners and opening edges, and wind load.

Polystyrene plates are covered with reinforced thin-layer plaster. Building corners and opening edges are reinforced with additional reinforcement elements. Plastering work is performed when the ambient temperature is not lower than 5°C.

## Block Installation
According to LST EN 1996-1-1:2005 requirements, masonry products must be bonded by offsetting products by distance a:
- Minimum masonry product bonding offset length: 10 cm
- At wall corners, the masonry product offset size a must be no less than the product width bu

HAUS SM6 and S6 concrete blocks are laid using general-purpose masonry mortar that complies with LST EN 1998-2 requirements. Horizontal joint thickness is 10-15 mm, depending on horizontal reinforcement. Vertical masonry joints are filled with masonry mortar.

## Mortar Volume Requirements
### HAUS S6
| Description | Volume (m³) | Weight (kg) |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Per block | 0.002 | 3.6 |
| Per m² wall | 0.016 | 36 |
| Per m³ wall | 0.09 | 162 |

## Reinforcement and Anchoring
Walls are reinforced with Ø6 S240 reinforcement bars every 1.0 m (see sections 2-2, 5-5, 8-8, 11-11). The spacing of support ties between walls and floors must not exceed 2 m for buildings up to 4 floors, and 1.25 m for taller buildings (LST EN 1996-1-1).

Walls are anchored in floors (columns) using Ø6 S240 reinforcement bars, which are placed in vertical (horizontal) masonry joints no less frequently than every 1.0 m (see sections 1-1, 4-4, 7-7, 10-10). A 3-4 cm gap is left between the last masonry row and the floor, later filled with thermal insulation material and intermediate layer.

Masonry reinforcement mesh for crack control or ductility is laid between the first and second, and second-to-last and last masonry rows (see sections 3-3, 6-6, 9-9, 12-12). The total reinforcement area must not be less than 0.03% of the total wall cross-section area (LST EN 1996-1-1).

## Lintel Installation
Reinforced lintels made from HAUS P6-20, P25, or P6-30 formwork blocks are designed as two-span beams. Formwork blocks are installed with a bottom wall cutout for the lintel tension reinforcement. An additional wall cutout can be made at the top of the formwork blocks for the lintel compression reinforcement.

### Lintel Support Requirements
HAUS lintels longer than 1.5 m must overlap masonry edges by at least 250 mm. Lintels shorter than 1.5 m can overlap by 150 mm. When selecting the lintel support surface length, it is necessary to consider the masonry bearing capacity in this zone. The support surface must be level and made from solid blocks. It is recommended to support on first group masonry products.

## Concrete Work
Concrete work is performed according to ST 121895674.06:2009 "Concrete Work" requirements:
- Concrete mixture is laid in horizontal layers across the entire area of the concrete structure
- For a homogeneous concrete structure, freshly prepared concrete mixture should be laid on the previous compacted layer before cement begins to set
- Before concreting HAUS formwork blocks, their surface is moistened with water

## Concrete Curing
In the initial stage of hardened concrete, a certain temperature and humidity regime must be maintained:
- Concrete is periodically watered
- In summer, protected from sunlight
- In winter, protected from frost
- Open concrete surfaces are covered no later than 10-12 hours after concreting completion

In summer, concrete made with ordinary Portland cement is watered for seven days. When air temperature is higher than 15°C, during the first three days concrete is watered every 3 hours during the day and once at night, later - no less than three times per day. The concreted structure can only be watered after 5-10 hours. When the average daily air temperature is 3°C or lower, concrete may not be watered.

The duration of concrete curing is determined considering cement hydration rate, concrete properties, ambient temperature, and relative humidity. Considering these factors, concrete curing duration ranges from 2 to 10 days. In cases where concrete must be resistant to moisture or is exposed to unfavorable environmental conditions, the curing duration must be extended.
