# Pile Foundations with Grillage

## Overview
The grillage is a foundation beam that connects piles and evenly distributes building loads to them. It is constructed using HAUS P6-20, P25, or P6-30 formwork blocks. The grillage height and width are selected according to acting loads, wall construction, plinth height, etc. Formwork blocks are placed on leveled ground or extruded solid polystyrene foam. The blocks have cutouts formed in their grooves for reinforcement installation. After installing HAUS formwork blocks and reinforcement cages, the grillage is concreted. Two layers of roll waterproofing are glued on top of the grillage.

## Block Installation
According to LST EN 1996-1-1:2005 requirements, masonry products must be bonded by offsetting products by distance a:
- Minimum masonry product bonding offset length: 10 cm
- Recommended bonding offset length: 25 cm

At grillage corners, to pass longitudinal reinforcement, the side wall of the block must be cut out.

HAUS P6-20, P25, or P6-30 corner formwork blocks can also be used in the middle part of the structure. In this case, the end wall of the block (groove) is cut out.

## Concrete Work in Negative Temperature
Concrete work is performed according to ST 121895674.06:2009 "Concrete Work" requirements:
- Concrete mixture is laid in horizontal layers across the entire area of the concrete structure
- For a homogeneous concrete structure, freshly prepared concrete mixture should be laid on the previous compacted layer before cement begins to set
- Before concreting HAUS formwork blocks, their surface is moistened with water

## Grillage Reinforcement Selection
Grillage reinforcement is calculated according to Eurocodes LST EN 1992-1-1:2005. Reinforced concrete grillage made from HAUS formwork blocks P6-20, P25, or P6-30 is calculated as a continuous multi-span beam supported on foundation and elastic base. Assembled formwork blocks are concreted with C 20/25 class concrete. S500 class reinforcement is used for reinforcement.

Transverse reinforcement anchoring is performed according to LST EN 1992-1-1:2005 requirements: anchored with hooks (a and b) or welded anchoring reinforcement (c and d).

## Ground Floor Thermal Insulation System
The floor base must be reliably compacted. Base compaction quality is evaluated according to the base compaction coefficient. Its value is specified in the project. The base above ground can be raised with compacted sand, gravel, or crushed stone layers. Each new layer thickness must not exceed 150 mm.

Polystyrene foam thermal insulation in floors can be made from one or several layers. When thermal insulation is made from several layers, their joints, except for floor edges, must not coincide. The distance between joints must be ≥ 200 mm. Concrete or mortar must not penetrate into polystyrene foam and its joints, therefore thermal insulation must be covered with a separating layer from above. Concrete, floor covering, and other layers above polystyrene foam must be separated from walls, partitions, columns, and other structures with sound-insulating intermediate layers. For this, sound-insulating polystyrene foam is recommended.
