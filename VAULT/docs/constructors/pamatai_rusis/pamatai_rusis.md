# Strip Foundation with Basement

## Overview
Basement walls are constructed by installing HAUS formwork blocks and concreting them. Depending on the soil and basement wall height, blocks of 20, 25, or 30 cm width are selected. For walls up to two meters high, 20 cm wide blocks are recommended, while for higher walls, 25-30 cm wide blocks are used.

Foundations for a house with a basement are built in an excavated pit. First, the support pad is concreted, with reinforcement bars embedded every 25-50 cm. These anchors connect the support pad and HAUS formwork block wall structure. For weak soil conditions, pile foundations are designed for the basement wall. After installing the floor above the basement, the foundation pit is backfilled with soil.

## Foundation Depth Selection
When selecting the foundation depth, consider:
- Frost depth
- Groundwater level
- Position of bearing soil layer
- Impact of excavations on adjacent structures
- Reduction of soil bearing capacity due to climatic effects

In a house with a basement, the foundation is installed 20-50 cm below the floor structure bottom. The foundation structure is embedded into the bearing soil layer from 10 to 100 cm.

## Block Installation
After excavating the foundation pit, the foundation pad is installed first, with a thickness under the HAUS formwork block wall of no less than 20 cm. The foundation pad is reinforced with reinforcement mesh.

According to LST EN 1996-1-1:2005 requirements, masonry products must be bonded by offsetting products by distance a:
- Minimum masonry product bonding offset length: 10 cm
- Recommended bonding offset length: 25 cm

At strip foundation corners, to pass longitudinal reinforcement, the side wall of the block must be cut out.

HAUS P6-20, P25, or P6-30 corner formwork blocks can also be used in the middle part of the structure. In this case, the end wall of the block (groove) is cut out.
