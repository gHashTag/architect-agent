# Strip Foundations

## Overview
A foundation is a part of a building that transfers loads to the ground. Foundations are classified into shallow, pile, and deep foundations.

For weak soil conditions, reinforced concrete monolithic strip foundations are recommended.

Shallow foundations are built in excavated trenches. After installing the foundation structure, the trench is backfilled with soil and compacted. These foundations transfer the building load to the ground. Shallow foundations are embedded no more than 3 meters deep.

The foundation consists of a reinforced concrete support pad and HAUS formwork block walls. Depending on the magnitude of acting loads and wall construction thickness, 20, 25, or 30 cm wide formwork blocks are selected.

Basement walls are also constructed using HAUS formwork blocks.

## Block Installation
After excavating the foundation trench, the foundation pad is installed first, with a thickness under the HAUS formwork block wall of no less than 20 cm. The foundation pad is reinforced with reinforcement mesh.

According to LST EN 1996-1-1:2005 requirements, masonry products must be bonded by offsetting products by distance a:
- Minimum masonry product bonding offset length: 10 cm
- Recommended bonding offset length: 25 cm

At strip foundation corners, to pass longitudinal reinforcement, the side wall of the block must be cut out.

HAUS P6-20, P25, or P6-30 corner formwork blocks can also be used in the middle part of the structure. In this case, the end wall of the block (groove) is cut out.

## Concrete Work
Concrete work is performed according to ST 121895674.06:2009 "Concrete Work" requirements:
- Concrete mixture is laid in horizontal layers across the entire area of the concrete structure
- For a homogeneous concrete structure, freshly prepared concrete mixture should be laid on the previous compacted layer before cement begins to set
- Before concreting HAUS formwork blocks, their surface is moistened with water
- Recommended to concrete up to three rows of blocks when concrete flow class is S3 (flowable)
- For high structures, concreting is done in stages
- Each stage involves concreting three and a half rows of blocks
- C20/25 class concrete is used
